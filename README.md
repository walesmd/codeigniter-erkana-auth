# Erkana Auth

Erkana, an open source authorization library for CodeIgniter. I originally released this
library [in October 2007](http://ellislab.com/forums/viewthread/63423/) as an easy-to-use,
non-invasive, solution. The version available here, v2, was [released in Feb 2010](http://www.michaelwales.com/2010/02/erkanaauth-version-2-0a/)
and is the final version of Erkana that I, personally, will release. It has spent the past
two years gathering cobwebs over at BitBucket; I am merely dusting it off long enough to
get it moved to GitHub in an attempt to consolidate my open source contributions underneath
one repository provider.

To all that used and enjoyed Erkana - thanks and feel free to fork it and take it to new
heights.
